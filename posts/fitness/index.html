        <h1>Fitness: How to get fit and why</h1>
        <h2>Why you should get fit:</h2>
        <p>Many people want to get fit to be more attractive and/or healthy. To that i would add another advantage: Getting fit helps you improve your self image and your confidence. Not only regarding your body and physical shape, but also your discipline
            and identity. Another advantage of getting fit is that it makes you not only stronger physically, but also mentally, making you more able to bare responsibility (and pain) in your life, a crucial thing to improve yourself, since <em>the obstacle is the way</em>
            <!-- <a href="" target="_blank">(Learn more)</a> -->. Another important part of fitness is fighting. It is very important because it makes you become strong and capable of protecting yourself and your family.</p>
        <h2>How can you get fit?</h2>
        <p>So, how do you get fit? You probably already know the short answer: diet and exercise. But this answer isn't enough, it's an oversemplification. There are some other factors at play, like sleep, recovery and stress levels. so now the questions
            become <a href="#how-do-i-diet">"How do i diet?"</a>, <a href="#how-do-i-exercise">"How do i exercise?"</a>, <a href="#how-do-i-sleep">"How do i sleep?"</a>, <a href="#how-do-i-recover">"How do i recover?"</a> and <a href="#how-do-i-reduce-my-stress-levels">"How do i reduce my stress levels?"</a>.</p>

            <h2>How do i diet?</h2>
            <p>Dieting doesn't have to be so restrictive, like a list of things to eat for the week (allowing no or very little variety), wich is very hard to maintain for more than a week or two, but it can, and in my opinion, should be something a lot
                more variable, sustainable, and enjoiable, since it has to be it for all your life. <em>Plan your diet keeping in mind that you're going to stick with it for all your life</em>. One thing that i want to mention is that the myth of "if
                it fits your macros" isn't true. The people that eat junk food believing that is it good for them if it fits their macronutrients not only will die young (yes, all those fitness youtubers that promote this), but also can't arrive at their
                peak physique, as they're constantly hungry since junk food is addictive. However, my advice is to not leave out any food, but to include healthy and fulfilling food in your diet. The best is to include a variety of fruits and vegetables
                (Yes i know i talk like your grandma), that are good for your gut microbiome and the make you full, so that then you don't have much space for unhealthy food. A very useful trick for identifying healthy foods is to search for base ingredients,
                not processed food. For example, don't eat chips (or fries or whatever), eat potatoes. Don't eat a hamburger, eat a pork steak. The non processed alternative is (basically) always better than the processed one. If you want to filter even
                more, eat poor food. by poor food i don't mean food poor of nutrients, i mean the type of food our grandparents and great grandparents ate. So the perfect example of poor food are eggs, they were layed every day by the hens, and basically
                everyone had a hen, so they ate like 2 - 3 eggs a day. i fact, even if some say that eggs are bad for you because they're high in colesterol, but it's now known that, for most people, they pose no harm.

                now know that milk is pretty bad for you (<a href="https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/nutrition-information/health-concerns-about-dairy" target="_blank">Learn more</a>).
            </p>
            <p>Another thing to do is to <em>limit sugar intake</em>, especially fructose, found in most fast foods, because it promotes the production of visceral fat (wich is the bad kind of fat), it is addictive and it spikes your insuline a lot more
                than glucose since it isn't used in the krebs cycle thus it isn't used by your body but directly goes in the blood, raises your insulin, and turned to fat. Not only that, the insulin inhibits the brain's sensitivity to leptin, a hormone
                that makes you feel full. What most google search results tell you, that fructose is completely safe, is a half truth, told by the food industries to not make a sensation of the fact that they're adding extra fructose to their food to
                make it even more addictive. It's a half truth and not a complete lie because there are some healthy sources of fructose, like, well, fruit, wich is very healthy in moderation (I recommend to pair fruit with high fat high protein food
                like eggs to make you feel fuller). Fruit's healthy because not only it is paired with fiber, that slows down its absorption, also because the concentration of fructose is not enough to make you addicted. But that doesn't apply to fast
                food, since it doesn't have much fiber and it has a high concentration of fructose. I really suggest that you learn more about this (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceFyF9px20Y" target="_blank">Learn more</a>).
            </p>
            <p> One last thing i would suggest is to fast, but not completely. I recommend only fasting from carbs, so protein and fats are allowed (I suggest more protein and less fats). So basically you dont eat carbs until it's lunchtime. During this period
                you should eat things like eggs, </p>
            <h3>Summarizing:</h3>
            <p>You should eat non processed, whole food (a trick is to eat base ingredients, for instance: eat potatoes, wholemeal flour and pork steaks instead of chips, pastry flour and hamburgers), avoid junk food if possible (a little cheat once in a
                while, especially if you eat with your friends and/or family, is okay), try to limit your sugar, especially fructose intake (fruit is perfectly okay, you should limit artificially added fructose in processed foods), and last but not least,
                instead of trying to make a super restrictive diet excluding some foods (that is going to hurt your social life too), try to make a non restrictive diet simply including more healthy and fulfilling food, like eggs, and any kind of fruits
                and vegetables (wich, by the way, are good for your gut microbiome too), not leaving anything out, simply including more of the good stuff.</p>

            <h2>How do i exercise?</h2>
            <p>So, how do you exercise? First thing i want to specify that i'm not talking to advanced athletes, but to beginners, so these advices are probably not optimal at 100%, but definitely enough for beginners. First thing, if you have a local gym
                with trainers and you can afford it, go there. Get a personalized program, while learning about fitness scientific research on youtube. Some youtubers i recommend are: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HybridCalisthenics">Hybrid Calisthenics</a>,
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffNippard">Jeff Nippard</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gregdoucette">Greg Doucette</a>, people that clearly know more than me. For both the gym goers and the ones that want to train at
                home, you should always, as greg doucette says, work harder than last time, to have an element of progressive overload. One way to do that, the most effective for me, is to put some goals to yourself on specific exercises, and write them
                down. After that, you workout and take note of how many reps and sets you manage to make, trying to reach the goal that you set yourself. when you manage to reach your goal without resting too much during the set, you set yourself another
                goal, a harder one (you could do that increasing the reps, sets, weight, or progression), and you continue like this, well, forever. There are different splits you can train with: You could have a full body split, so you train your whole
                body 2 - 3 times a week, an upper - lower split, where you train only upper body two - three days a week, and lower another two - three days a week and a push - pull - legs split, where you train pushing movements, like push ups, two times
                a week, pulling movements, like pull ups, two times a week and legs another two times a week. I personally use the full body workout three times a week, since i have a busy schedule and this allows me to train 3 times a week total, but
                the most used split is the upper - lower split.
